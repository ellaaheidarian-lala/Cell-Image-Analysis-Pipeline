# Quantitative Cell Biology: Image Analysis & Segmentation Pipeline
## Researcher: Elaheh Heydarian Gorji 
### Targeted for: Gerlich Lab | IMBA - Institute of Molecular Biotechnology

This repository demonstrates a computational workflow for high-throughput image analysis of cell nuclei. The project focuses on automating the segmentation and classification of cellular structures, a core requirement for studying chromosome organization and cell division.

## 🧬 Scientific Relevance
In modern cell biology, quantifying morphological changes in chromosomes and nuclei is essential. This pipeline utilizes machine learning to:
- Detect and segment cell nuclei from microscopy datasets.
- Extract quantitative features (Area, Perimeter, Eccentricity) to analyze structural variations.
- Provide interpretable visualizations for experimental validation.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV and Scikit-image for pre-processing and noise reduction.
- **Deep Learning/ML:** Implementation of segmentation algorithms to identify biological boundaries.
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn for translating raw image data into statistical insights.

## 🚀 Skills for Bioinformatician Role
- **Python:** Robust scripting for data processing.
- **Automated Workflows:** Building pipelines from raw microscopic data to final visualization.
- **Collaboration Ready:** Code is documented for technical exchange and peer review.
